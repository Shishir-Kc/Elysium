"""
This file contains code for doewnloading config / checking config  version / updating config 
Mainly the config is for A.R.I.A Additionals (  ' plug and play ' ) architecture .
Furter more EL can automatically / independently call these methods / function as tools ,
so it can decide when to update .
The additionals code is in sepereate repo of the developer called Elysium_additionals 
Link : https://github.com/Shishir-Kc/Elysium_additionals , developer might move the code to
personal hosted server for the additionals.

What is additionals ?

well in simple terms Additionals is a way for EL to learn and controll new skills or tools to improve its performance, 
Additionals can we configured according to user liking , base version of E.Y.S.I.U.M will not contain all the functionality of Additionals
but it can be downloaded manually by cli or just ask el to download it
